Laravel PSD Reader Package
======

Photoshop is the leading graphical image manipulation program. Many designers even use it to sketch the layout of Web pages. PHP comes with built-in support to read and write images in many formats using the GD library. However, it does not support the Photoshop image format: PSD.

This class/package fill partly that void by reading Photoshop PSD image files and creating a GD image resource from the Photoshop image bitmaps.
